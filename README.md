## Installation

To install locally, clone the app to your local directory and run `dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json System.Drawing.Common`

## Usage

To use the app, in CLI run `dotnet run` and the app will initialize. You will then be asked whether you'd like to use the "user generator API" or ADD employees manually. If you choose the API, the app will create 10 random employee badges using the Random User Generator API. If you choose "ADD", you will be prompted to enter the new employee's name, last name, employee id and photo URL. Leave the "name" blank to exit the app.
